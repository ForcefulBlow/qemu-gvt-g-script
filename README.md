# qemu-gvt-g-script
Simple script that creates virtual machines with gvt-g intel GPU virtualization


This script creates a folder with VM image, and like you can um... yeah, have gvt-g passthrough with minimal effort, as I figured out how teh fuck it works for you. 
I still don't understand why virtualbox, gnome boxes or libvirt don't have fuck off and easy way to get gvt-g virtualization shit working as damn m8, this shit is good, way better than WINE+Proton as you're not dealing with shitty attempts to copy WinAPI bug-to-bug, but with real-ish hardware.

There is a catch tho. This shit isnt exactly stable and im not responsible for any accidental data damage:D

Cheers

P.S. It might not work on your distribution/machine, but I use opensuse tumbleweed, and i will keep updating this script if it would get broken
